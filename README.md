# Martinica
The Martinica Ultra Low Power transmission module consists of ATSAMD21 microcontroller unit with ATWINC1500 Wi-Fi (802.11 b/g/n) module.

The board is in Arduino MKR form factor can be  programmed with Arduino IDE or with Atmel Studio 7 IDE from Microchip enabling fast application development.

Onboard BME688 Environmental Sensor with A.I. from Bosch Sensortec allows real world testing.

This repository contains sources for Arduino IDE integration and board testing.
